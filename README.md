# Conditional Diffusion for Time-Series Generation

This project implements a **denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM)** from scratch to generate realistic **time-series sequences**, using financial log-returns as a concrete example.

The objective is **generative modeling**, not forecasting.

---

## Overview

Diffusion models are typically applied to images, but many real-world problems involve **1D sequential data** such as sensor signals, biomedical waveforms, or financial returns.

This project investigates whether diffusion models can:
- Learn the distribution of time-series sequences
- Preserve temporal structure
- Generate realistic samples from noise

---

## Data

- Daily closing prices of the S&P 500 index
- Prices are converted to **log-returns** for stationarity
- Fixed-length sliding windows of 128 timesteps
- Global normalization across the dataset

Each sequence is treated as a single data object.

> This is **not** a time-series forecasting task.

## Method

### Diffusion Framework
- Forward process: Gaussian noise is gradually added to real sequences
- Reverse process: a neural network learns to iteratively remove noise
- Training objective: predict the added noise using mean squared error (MSE)

### Model Architecture
- 1D UNet with temporal convolutions
- Skip connections for multi-scale feature preservation
- Linear output layer (no activation) to predict noise

---

## Training Objective

The model minimizes:

\[
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}\left[\|\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)\|^2\right]
\]

where:
- \(x_t\) is the noisy sequence at diffusion step \(t\)
- \(\epsilon\) is Gaussian noise
- \(\epsilon_\theta\) is the model’s noise prediction

---

## Sampling

New sequences are generated by:
1. Sampling pure Gaussian noise
2. Iteratively applying the learned reverse diffusion process
3. Producing a synthetic time-series sequence

The generated outputs are stochastic, temporally coherent, and statistically similar to real data.

---

## Evaluation

Since this is a generative model, evaluation is **distributional**, not predictive.

Evaluation focuses on:
- Mean and standard deviation
- Visual comparison of real vs generated sequences
- Qualitative temporal structure

Further analysis may include autocorrelation and volatility structure.
